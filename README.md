# Color Selector
### This is a helper app for UI color schemes. 
- Currently you can modify the Red, Green and Blue values of a color and it will show the color in the background and give the hex value on the side.
- It can also produce a random color at the click of a button, automatically showing the RGB and hex values.
- In the future, the goal is that you can choose a primary color for your UI, and it will give back a list of colors that you can use.
    - These colors will include shades of gray, shades of your primary color, and other colors that could work as accent colors
